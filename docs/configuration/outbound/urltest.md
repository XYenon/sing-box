### Fields

#### outbounds

==Required==

List of outbound tags to test.

#### url

The URL to test. `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` will be used if empty.

#### interval

The test interval. `3m` will be used if empty.

#### tolerance

The test tolerance in milliseconds. `50` will be used if empty.

#### idle_timeout

The idle timeout. `30m` will be used if empty.

#### interrupt_exist_connections

Interrupt existing connections when the selected outbound has changed.

Only inbound connections are affected by this setting, internal connections will always be interrupted.

#### consecutive_failure_limit

The number of consecutive connection failures on the currently selected outbound before automatically switching to the next best outbound. `0` (default) disables this feature.

When the limit is reached, the failed outbound's delay history is deleted and the best available outbound is re-selected immediately, without waiting for the next health check cycle. The failure counter resets on any successful connection or when the selected outbound changes.
